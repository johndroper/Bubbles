# RimDialogueClient 

This project is a fork of https://github.com/Jaxe-Dev/Bubbles

RimDialogue is an extension to Rimworldâ€™s builtin interactions system.   It takes the  basic interactions your pawns have with each other like, "Stomp chatted about board games with Mekkie." and uses a LLM to translate that into actual dialogue.  That dialogue is then shown in game above the characters head in a bubble.

The following base methods are patched with Harmony:
```
Postfix : RimWorld.PlaySettings.DoPlaySettingsGlobalControls
Postfix : RimWorld.MapInterface.MapInterfaceOnGUI_BeforeMainTabs
Postfix : Verse.PlayLog.Add
Prefix  : Verse.Profile.MemoryUtility.ClearAllMapsAndWorld
```
